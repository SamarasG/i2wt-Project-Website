NEAR Protocol is a discentralized blockchain, operationg on a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, launched in April of 2020 by the NEAR Foundation , a nonprofit 
corporation based in Switcherland [2].
Founded by Eric Trautman {lonk : (https://near.org/blog/near-foundation-ceo-transition-a-note-from-erik-trautman/)},
Illia Polosukhin {link:(https://golden.com/wiki/Illia_Polosukhin-AMMYWMX)}and Alexander Skidanov {link:(https://golden.com/wiki/Alexander_Skidanov-399M3EA)},
the NEAR Foundation aims to create an ecosysten that will allow for fast and easy development of Digital Applications [1][2][3]. That goal is currently persued by the
NEAR Protocols tool repository on GitHub that would allow developers to create DApps and integrate smart contract protocols, Non Fungable Token creation, and DApp 
redeployment from the Etherium mainnet to the NEAR Protocol through the Rainbow Bridge {link:(https://near.org/bridge/)} as well as the direct exchange between the 
tokens of the two blockchains [2][3].On the tokenomics side {link:(https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-does-it-matter)} we can see 
that one billion tokens were created at the launch of the blockchain ,and there is also a 5% inflation of tokens per year, of whitch 80% is
destributed to validator nodes and 20% to the NEAR Foundation Treasury , that uses these funds to ,among other things ,provide grants to developers to subsidize the 
development of the NEAR Protocol ecosystem [2]. Diflationary presure is aplied throught fees for the use of the blockchain levied on all users . Of the miniscule 
fees required for the use of the Protocol 70% is burnt and other 30% is given to the validators [1][2].
