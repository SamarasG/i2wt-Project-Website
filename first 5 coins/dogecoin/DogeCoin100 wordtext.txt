Dogecoin is the native token of the homonymous blockchain best known for being the first meme coin [1][2].
The blockchain was created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer,both of them experienced software engineers. The token is not owned by a centralized organization, and 
that makes it one of the few trully decentalized blockchains.Launched on the 6th of December 2013, Dogecoin became an internet sensetion practically over night,
 surpacing the trading volume of Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies in existance a month later [1].All this atracted the interest of malicious actors 
 that tried to attack the blockchain, an act that led to the mergure of the Dogecoin blockchain with the LiteCoin (LTC) blockchain in 2014 [5]. After the meteoric rise 
 of the token both in value and in recognision among other blockchains, the re-establishment of the Dogecoin Foundation was desided and acted upon on the 14th of 
 August 2021 [1].At it's pick in May 2021 Dogecoin reached a market capitalization of 84.5 billion U.S.Dollars [4].
 With the face of a dog (Shiba Inu) as it's logo this token was initially created to as a critic to the statments of other blockchain creators that the tecknology 
 behind the cryptocurency would take oner the world and radically change it [1][4].Without the impossition of a limit to number of tokens that can be minted through 
 Dogecoins Proof of Work algorithm  , inflation is an intrensic carateristic of the value of the token [4].
